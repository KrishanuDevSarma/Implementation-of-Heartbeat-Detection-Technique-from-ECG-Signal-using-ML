# ECG Heartbeat Detection Project

## Overview

Hello, fellow developers! I'm Krishanu Dev Sarma, and this repository houses my project for the study and implementation of a heartbeat detection technique from ECG signals using MATLAB. The primary focus is on signal processing techniques, including noise removal through low-pass and high-pass filters and R-peak detection.

## Project Structure

1. **Data:** The `data` folder contains sample ECG signals for testing.
2. **Code:** MATLAB scripts for signal processing and R-peak detection.
    - `preprocess_ecg.m`: Implements noise removal through low-pass and high-pass filters.
    - `detect_r_peaks.m`: Utilizes MATLAB for R-peak detection.

## Technical Details

### Types of Noises in ECG Signal

1. **Baseline Wander:** Low-frequency variations caused by body movements.
2. **Powerline Interference:** High-frequency noise from power sources.
3. **Muscle Artifacts:** High-frequency noise caused by muscle movements.
4. **Electrode Motion Artifacts:** Abrupt changes due to electrode displacement.

### Noise Removal Technique

1. **Low-Pass Filter:** Attenuates high-frequency noise, preserving the slower-changing ECG signal.
   
   ```matlab
   % Example code for low-pass filtering
   ecg_signal_lowpass = lowpass(ecg_signal, cutoff_frequency, sampling_frequency);
   ```

2. **High-Pass Filter:** Eliminates baseline wander and low-frequency noise.
   
   ```matlab
   % Example code for high-pass filtering
   ecg_signal_highpass = highpass(ecg_signal, cutoff_frequency, sampling_frequency);
   ```

### R-Peak Detection Using MATLAB

MATLAB provides robust tools for peak detection. The `findpeaks` function is particularly useful.

```matlab
% Example code for R-peak detection
[peaks, locations] = findpeaks(ecg_signal, 'MinPeakHeight', threshold);
```

## Pros and Cons of MATLAB

### Pros:

1. **Rich Signal Processing Toolbox:** MATLAB's extensive toolbox simplifies signal processing tasks.
2. **Community Support:** A large and active MATLAB community provides ample resources and solutions.
3. **Versatility:** MATLAB is well-suited for prototyping and research in signal processing applications.

### Cons:

1. **Cost:** MATLAB is a commercial software, and licensing costs can be a factor for some users.
2. **Learning Curve:** For those unfamiliar with MATLAB, there might be an initial learning curve.
3. **Limited Parallel Processing:** MATLAB's parallel processing capabilities are limited compared to some other languages.

## Advice for Developers

1. **Understand ECG Signals:** Gain a solid understanding of ECG signals and the nature of different types of noise.
2. **Optimize Filtering Parameters:** Fine-tune filter parameters based on your specific signal characteristics.
3. **Explore MATLAB Documentation:** MATLAB's documentation is a goldmine. Explore it for in-depth insights.

## Conclusion

This project aims not only to detect heartbeats but to provide a learning platform for signal processing enthusiasts. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute. Let's keep the heartbeat of open source pulsating!
